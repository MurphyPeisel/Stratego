---------------------------- WELCOME ----------------------------
                        Welcome to Stratego! 
The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag. 
As the commander of an army you are in charge of 33 movable 
units of differing rank and 7 immovable pieces.

    |-------------------------| |--------------------------|

---------------------------- SETUP ----------------------------
Player 1 places all of their pieces on their 4 x 10 side 
of the gameboard. Then, player 2 does the same on their 
4 x 10 side of the gameboard.

--------------------------- GAMEPLAY ---------------------------
On your turn, you must do one of the following:
MOVE one of your playing pieces to an open adjacent space. 
    1. Pieces move one square at a time, forward, backward, 
    or sideways. (Exception: See special Scout Movement Privilege)

    2. Pieces cannot move diagonally. They cannot jump over another
    piece. They cannot move onto a square already occupied by another
    piece (unless attacking)

    3. Pieces cannot jump over or move onto the two lake areas 
    in the center of the gameboard.

    4. A piece cannot move back and forth between the same two 
    squares in three consecutive turns. 
                        OR 
ATTACK one of your opponents playing pieces. 
     NOTE: Flag and Bomb pieces cannot attack.
     1. Attack Position: When a red and blue piece are 
     orthogonally adjacent, they are in a position to attack.
     
     2. How to Attack: To attack on your turn, click on your piece 
     and then click on the piece you would like to attack. 
     The rank of each piece is then revealed and the piece with the 
     lower rank is removed from the board. If the winning piece
     is the attacker, it takes the place of the losing piece. If the
     winning piece is the defender, it does not move. 
     
     3. When pieces of the same rank battle, both pieces
     are removed from the board. 

NOTE: If you cannot do either action, the game is over and
you lose.
                 
Special Scout Privileges:
    Scouts are the only pieces allowed to both move and
    attack on the same turn. A Scout can move forward,
    backward, or sideways any number of open spaces into an
    attack position. Once in position, it can attack.

Special Miner Privileges:
    When any piece (except a Miner) strikes a Bomb, that piece is 
    removed from the board. Exception: When a Miner strikes a Bomb,
    the Bomb is defused and removed from the gameboard. The Miner
    then moves onto the Bomb's space on the board. Bombs remain on
    the same space throughout the game unless they are defused.
    Bombs cannot attack or move. 

Special Spy Privileges:
   The Spy is rank "S". If any piece attacks the Spy, it is 
   removed from the board. The Spy is also the only piece that can
   capture a Marshal, provided the Spy attacks the Marshal first.
   If the Marshal attacks first, then the Spy is removed.

                        
----------------------- WINNING THE GAME -----------------------
The first player to attack an opponent's Flag captures it and 
wins the game.

If all of your movable pieces have been removed and you cannot
move or attack on a turn, you must give up and declare your
opponent the winner.
